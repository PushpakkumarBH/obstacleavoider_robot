# ObstacleAvoider


Obstacle Avoider is an intelligent device which can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself.
This smart car has various features like:
following a straight line path,
following a curved line path,
turning left or right as per the convenience for avoiding obstacles.
It takes input from an IR proximity or ultrasonic sensor to detect any obstacle.
Its speed can be controlled easily by a function.
It also has a Fail-safe kill switch which can be used in case of any malfunctioning of motor driver.
This switch will turn off the power supply to motor driver which results in stopping the car instantly.
On an advanced level: You can add an IMU (MPU-6050/MPU-9050) data, to get the orientation of the bot.

This project contains the sample code for arduino and image output of them used for simulation in proteus software.
Simply implement your algorithm and test it out in proteus or real hardware. Share the .ino and image files of the same for each issue that you solve.

Even this pandemic can’t stop us from making hardware projects, thanks to the simulators.

### I recommend using microcontroller based boards like Arduino,etc.

To get started with Arduino and it’s IDE follow this playlist
I recommend using Proteus to simulate the project and test it in case you don’t have access to the hardware components.
